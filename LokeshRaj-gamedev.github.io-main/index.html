The primary goal was to ensure that users could access and manipulate data without relying on an internet connection, making the application more versatile and user-friendly.<p>I began by designing the database schema tailored to the specific needs of the application, ensuring optimal organization and accessibility of data. Utilizing SQLite’s capabilities, I integrated data insertion, retrieval, updating, and deletion functionalities. The project involved creating an intuitive user interface that allowed users to interact with the database seamlessly, enabling them to add, view, edit, and delete records easily.<p> Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure data integrity and reliability, addressing potential issues such as data conflicts and corruption. The project was not only a practical application of database management principles but also an exploration of best practices in user interface design and data handling.<p>This project significantly improved my skills in database management, C# programming, and Unity development, laying a strong foundation for future endeavors involving data-driven applications.</p>',
