  <div class="Interests">
      <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
      <p>I’m deeply fascinated by the world of interactive technology and its transformative potential in how we experience and engage with reality. Game design is a creative outlet where I find immense joy in bringing ideas to life and crafting compelling narratives through gameplay. Virtual and augmented reality captivate me not just as emerging technologies, but as powerful tools to reshape industries and redefine user experiences.

I’m particularly drawn to integrating haptic feedback into VR projects to add a tangible layer of realism and immersion. While my analytical side thrives on backend development and solving complex technical problems, I equally enjoy the artistic aspects of animation and visual effects, using them to build immersive, emotionally resonant digital worlds.

Beyond development, I’m also passionate about the business side of technology—especially sales and marketing. I enjoy translating technical innovations into value propositions, building customer connections, and strategizing go-to-market plans that make cutting-edge solutions accessible and impactful.

Constantly curious, I keep an eye on the latest trends in AI, cloud computing, and interactive media—always exploring how new advancements can push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

  <div class="Experience">
      <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
      <p><b>Senior Unity Developer at Merkel Haptic Systems Pvt. Ltd., Chennai (March 2025 - Present)</b></p>
      <p>At Merkel Haptic Systems, I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to design and develop cutting-edge VR applications, focusing on user engagement and haptic feedback integration. My work includes refining game mechanics, optimizing code for VR performance, and implementing immersive experiences using the latest Unity tools and techniques. I also contribute to testing and debugging, ensuring high-quality deliverables that meet project requirements. My role involves continually researching new technologies and techniques to incorporate into our projects, driving innovation in the VR space.</p>
      <p><b>Software Developer at IIT Madras - Touch Lab, Chennai (July 2021 - March 2025 )</b></p>
      <p>During my time working across industry and academic collaborations—including at IIT Madras—I have been deeply involved in the development of cutting-edge VR applications using Unity. I played a key role in building interactive training simulators, immersive environments, and haptic-enabled systems that bridge the gap between physical and virtual experiences.

I was instrumental in integrating backend systems to ensure real-time data communication between VR applications and external hardware, developing scalable solutions in C#. 

Collaborating closely with researchers, engineers, and product teams, I developed simulation features tailored for specific domains—ranging from CPR and fire safety training to engine assembly and disassembly modules. These projects demanded a deep understanding of both technical implementation and user experience, where I also contributed to intuitive interaction design.

Beyond development, I took an active role in product demonstrations, user training, and client installations—merging my technical knowledge with communication and marketing to support product adoption and feedback collection. This blend of creative development and strategic outreach helped deliver impactful XR solutions in both research and real-world settings.
